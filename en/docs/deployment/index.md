# Project Deployment

Friends Feed is deployed with **frontend-backend separation**. Choose the setup that suits you.

## Deployment Options

- [Backend Deployment](/docs/deployment/backend) â€“ Provides the API service, responsible for data scraping and processing  
- [Frontend Deployment](/docs/deployment/frontend) â€“ Renders the display page and aggregates the friend feed  

---

ðŸ’¡ We recommend finishing **backend deployment** first to ensure the API is live, then proceeding with **frontend deployment** to display the feed.
